# System-Analysis-and-Design | Developer: Justin Starr

# Hello, and welcome to the System Analysis and Design Repository of my Academic Projects🖐️

Learned to effectively and professionally communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences. Created system models using industry tools. UML Diagrams include Object, Sequence, Activity, Class, and Use Case Diagrams. <br><br>

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass Project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, is a company that found a niche market where they determined that a significant amount of driving students failed their driving test on their first attempt. The client decided they could help driving students pass their exams by providing a means for students to access resources, such as practice tests, online. The client requested that a cloud-based system be implemented to help reduce the amount of their resources that would be necessary for maintenance and updating purposes, all while providing a means for their users to log into the system, view/update their profile, schedule office appointments, take online training, receive updates from the Department of Motored Vehicles, and schedule on-the-road driving training. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I had various strengths and weaknesses throughout the course. I believe the thing I did the best job at was creating the various diagrams that were used in the second project (UML Activity, Sequence, and Object Diagrams).

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise the business requirements document. After having receive feedback about what I had submitted, I realize that I did in fact list many functional requirements that were actually non-functional. 

# How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

For me, interpreting the needs of the user simply came down to "listening" to the client's needs. During the requirements-gathering phase, it was essential to pay attention to the details that were provided, which essentially provided a pathway for the various processes or functions the system should perform. The reason why it is so important to consider the user's needs when designing a system is because they are the different types of people that are going to be utilizing the system. If the system cannot perform what the users need it to do, then the system is pointless. This applies to both customers and DriverPass users. If the system does not provide a means or resources that benefit and enable students to pass their driving test on their first attempt, then the system fails. If the system cannot be utilized by office staff to help register customers, schedule appointments, etc., the system fails. A system must be designed to perform the desired results by the client; however, it is also important that developers keep in mind and practice ethical systems development.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Software should be designed similarly to designing a system. First planning and analysis occurs, and then the software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Even though there does exist various methodologies for this process, software, like systems, should be designed in phases that allow for changes or flexibility and adaptability along the way. Strategies I believe I will utilize in the future include having face-to-face communications with clients during the requirements gathering phase, as well as creating and makeing use of various UML diagrams, such as Use Case, Activity, Sequence, and Object Diagrams.
